### Synopsis

The evil Lord Drakkis has raised his forces against King KveldUlf.  Quick in his response to the threat KveldUlf rallies his armies and lays seige to Drakkis' mighty fortress.  However, with neither side being able to gain an advantage the two forces are locked in stalemate.  King KveldUlf calls upon you, a prisoner sentenced to die for horrible crimes, to redeam yourself by infiltrating the castle and slaying Lord Drakkis.
